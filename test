We are noticing an issue in our current openshift env where the connection between seldon-controller & ocp k8s api server keeps disconnecting frequently. We discussed this behaviour with Seldon Support Team and they provided openshift specific installation instructions which require the following pre-requisites.

 
OpenShift Installation Doc: https://deploy.seldon.io/en/latest/contents/getting-started/openshift-installation/index.html#introduction
 
Pre-Requisites list of operators required to be installed on ocp cluster:

Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (provided by Red Hat) (1.39.0-3)*
Kiali Operator (provided by Red Hat) (1.57.3)*
Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh (provided by Red Hat) (2.3.0)*
 
We also do not have privilage to look at installed operators in the cluster. Could you give us read privilages to look into it ?
